* PARTICIPANTS

This document details the terms of an exclusive contract to investigate the
current state of a program. The contract is between Adlai, the author of the
program and the commissioner of this contract, and [you! yes yooOOUUU! ou?],
identified by adversarial neural networks operated on unknown basis set(s).

* PROGRAM
** LOCATION
Archival of the program is performed upon request; old copies were once
occasionally found at the following locations:

   http://adlai.uncommon-lisp.org:7421/scalpl_310b539.tar.gz
   git+http://www.github.com/adlai/scalpl.git/

... and possibly others.

** HASHES
PROGRAM IN QUESTION SNAPSHOT OF THE KNOT-AUTOMATED NOT AUTOMATION NO
system. since this program is under continual development, the files
relevant to this contract have their hashes fixed at:

~/path/to/basket/ $ hashof *.{uml,lol,mno,svg,uml,uml,uml,uml,uml,uml
#x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 uml.uml

The first file in the above list is not covered by the contract; it is only
provided in the archive because management practices best practices, myeah.

* COMMISSION
** COMMENTS
The commission is for writing the toplevel comment blocks that preceed
definitions in relevant files, highlighting and explaining noteworthy
aspects of the immediately following form's behavior: most importantly,
all numeric values beg an explanation of their effect, and the effective
domain in which to vary their values; suggestions of changes are welcome,
although neither required, nor expected, at any stage of the process.
** SOFTWARE
The commission does not require writing, nor running, any software; although,
the consultant may include software changes in the patches delivered, without
preference specified regarding authorship of such changes by any consultants.
** DELIVERY
The comments should be made available as patches to the above files, along with
exactly one cryptographic signature covering the entire delivered item, with
allowance for hierarchies of maximal depth agreed upon in advance, and stating
an address for payment; it is preferred, although not required, that the payment
address and signing key be computationally related.  It is permissible to
request payments granularized per comment within files, or a strictly coarser
topology. The files should be available for public download and access by
automated archival services; any signed statements should be notarized, such as
http://deedbot.org; if Bitcoin is unusable, any similar service that displays
information freely verifiable by the public.
** DEADLINE
This hook has no deadline, proposed compensation, nor expectation of bites.

* PAYMENT
** DESTINATION
The payments for each unit of delivered work will be sent to Bitcoin addresses
designated in the signed statements. Provision of multiple addresses that rely
upon a number of keys smaller than the number of addresses is discouraged.
** ALLOCATION
Verbal gratitude (0.00000000 Bitcoin) is offered as upfront payment, along with
options vested at the next Bitcoin reward halving. Your entitlement to verbal
gratitude for reading to the end of this file is voided by this sentence.

The precise amount of each payment varies according to Adlai's judgement, and
depends objectively upon the proportion of each file covered, and subjectively
upon the quality of the comments themselves; the allocation for each file is
according to a combination of its size, and relative overall importance:

Filename   Allocation   Emphasis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uml        0.00000000   Robots are people too, Mr. White! Ask any chop shop, yo.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
actor      #C(0x0 pi)   sketches for a multiprocessing primitive, originally
                        nonsieved before reading the Ada specification, and
                        intended eventually to mimic Ada's task structure;
                        arguably, this should be a standalone library.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** COMPUTATION
The payment allocations should be determined in a manner that leaves at most one
phith of the computed amount to the commissioner's judgement, outside of
situations where the delivered item is considered ineligible for compensation,
with the computation of the golden ratio taken to any precision beyond half.

This document details the terms of an exclusive contract to investigate the
current state of a program. The contract is between Adlai, the author of the
program and the commissioner of this contract, identified by PGP fingerprint

and verisimilitude, identified by PGP fingerprint

* PROGRAM
** LOCATION
An archived copy of the program is available at the URL:

   http://adlai.uncommon-lisp.org:7421/scalpl_310b539.tar.gz

** HASHES
The program in question is a snapshot of the ScalpL automated trading
system. Since this program is under continual development, the files
relevant to this contract have their hashes fixed at:

~/path/to/scalpl/ $ sha1sum *.lisp
c85a0d7e3279e0097348c12a9f9556497ccc7d1e  util.lisp
a343de9e6a8675596b380df582acdf504348f5a3  actor.lisp

ae1d2f38f8e781bab9e1f88d984966db39592e14  poloniex.lisp

The first file in the above list is not covered by the contract. It is only
provided in the archive because the code depends on the utilities within.

* COMMISSION
** COMMENTS
The commission is for writing toplevel comment blocks, preceeding the toplevel
definitions in relevant files, highlighting and explaining noteworthy aspects of
the immediately following form's behavior; specifically, hardcoded parameters
beg an explanation of their effect and the effective domain from which to choose
their values. Suggestions of changes are welcome, although not required.
** SOFTWARE
The commission does not require writing, nor running, any software, although
verisimilitude may include software changes in the patches delivered.
** DELIVERY
The comments should be made available as patches to the above files, along with
a PGP-signed statement including the hash of the patch file, and designating an
address for payment. It is permissable to request a separate payment for work
done on a single file, or groups of files. The files should be available for
public download, and accessible to access by website archival services; and the
signed statements should be notarized by deedbot.
** DEADLINE
The offer is valid until the end of 2020-11-08 UTC

* PAYMENT
** DESTINATION
The payments for each unit of delivered work will be sent to Bitcoin addresses
designated in the signed statements. The addresses do not have to be identical.
** ALLOCATION
One Bitcent (0.01000000 Bitcoin) is offered as upfront payment, with further
payment after delivery of patches to the various files. The initial payment, if
requested, will be deducted from the payment after the first delivery.

The precise amount of each payment varies according to Adlai's judgement, and
depends objectively upon the proportion of each file covered, and subjectively
upon the quality of the comments themselves; the allocation for each file is
according to a combination of its size, and relative overall importance:

Filename   Allocation   Emphasis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
util       0.00000000   provided solely for reference purposes

actor      0.01081081   sketches for a multiprocessing primitive, originally
                        conceived before reading the Ada specification, although
                        intended eventually to mimic Ada's task structure;
                        arguably, this should be a standalone library.

exchange   0.02594595   interface to be provided for each specific exchange, and
                        a bit of the trading program's logic; much of this needs
                        reworking, as it all grew in layers from a prototype.

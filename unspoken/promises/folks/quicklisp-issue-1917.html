12:49 &lt;adlai&gt; ultimately, what seems best to me right now is for scalpl itself to be outside of the default dist, although it should not require any software outside of the default dist.
12:50 &lt;adlai&gt; as I've mentioned before, the current code is also replete with practices ranging from mediocre to worst.
13:06 * adlai should also take about a decade or few to get enough familiarity with the retail investor platforms so that scalpl can speak the protocol of at least one regular stock exchange
13:08 &lt;adlai&gt; so far, it has been mostly speaking to various 'greysuit' digital currency exchanges, during the happy years before they get love letters from government agencies; it is a fun game, and quite useful for a certain class of people, although still - quite a narrow niche.
13:21 &lt;adlai&gt; phoe: I explicitly wrote &quot;public domain&quot;, and never included any copyright notice in the scalpl files, because I do not consider that tool an innovation, by this point in human history.
